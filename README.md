Customer Involvement: Agile involves customers throughout; Waterfall engages them primarily at the beginning and end.

Agile: Preferred for projects with evolving requirements, where flexibility, rapid deployment, and continuous customer feedback are essential. It suits complex projects where the full scope is not fully known upfront.

Waterfall: Preferred for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, where predictability and strict adherence to timelines and budgets are critical. It is suitable for projects with clear milestones and a defined endpoint.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirements engineering is the process of gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs of a software system. It's the foundation for a successful software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it ensures the final product meets the expectations of all stakeholders, including the end-users.
process:
Elicitation: This involves collecting information from various stakeholders through interviews, workshops, document analysis, and user observation.
Analysis: The collected information is reviewed and analyzed to identify functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements define what the system should do, while non-functional requirements address quality attributes like performance, security, and usability.
Specification: Documented requirements become a formal agreement between stakeholders and developers. This document serves as a blueprint for the development process.
Validation: Requirements are validated to ensure they are clear, complete, consistent, achievable, and relevant. This involves user reviews, prototyping, and feasibility studies.
Importance in SDLC:
Requirements engineering sets the direction for the entire SDLC.  Here's why it's crucial:
Reduces Development Cost: Clear requirements minimize rework and scope creep, which can significantly increase development costs.
Increases Quality: Well-defined requirements lead to a product that meets user needs and expectations.
Improves Communication: The process fosters communication between stakeholders and developers, leading to a better understanding of the project goals.

Software design principles guide the development of software systems to improve design quality.
Key Principles:
Modularity: Divide software into manageable modules.
Abstraction: Hide complex details and focus on essential features.
Encapsulation: Group related data and functions, expose necessary interfaces.
Separation of Concerns: Divide software into distinct sections for clarity and maintainability.
Loose Coupling: Components should be independent and have minimal dependencies on each other.
High Cohesion: Modules should have a single, well-defined purpose and perform related tasks.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity is a fundamental principle in software design that emphasizes dividing a complex software system into smaller, self-contained units called modules.  These modules perform specific tasks and interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.
By combining these modules, you can build complex structures (like a car or a house) while keeping each piece independent and reusable.
key aspects of modularity:
High Cohesion: Modules should have a single, well-defined purpose and perform closely related tasks. This increases code readability and maintainability.
Low Coupling: Modules should have minimal dependencies on each other. This minimizes the impact of changes in one module on other parts of the system.
Clear Interfaces: Modules interact through well-defined interfaces that specify how data is exchanged. This promotes loose coupling and simplifies integration.
Benefits for Maintainability and Scalability
Modularity brings several advantages to software development, particularly in terms of maintainability and scalability:
Maintainability:
Isolation of Changes: Changes made to a specific module are less likely to break other parts of the system due to loose coupling. This makes debugging and fixing issues easier.
Improved Code Readability: Smaller, well-defined modules with clear functionalities are easier to understand and modify for developers.
Reusability: Modules can be reused in different parts of the same system or even in other projects, reducing development time and effort.
Scalability:
Modular Growth: Adding new features or functionalities can be achieved by creating new modules without modifying existing ones. This allows the system to grow organically.
Independent Deployment: Modules can be independently deployed and updated, facilitating easier maintenance and faster rollouts of new features.
Parallelisation: Modular design enables parallel development, where different teams can work on separate modules concurrently, accelerating the development process.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Software goes through various testing stages before release to ensure it functions correctly and meets user expectations. Here's a breakdown of the four main testing levels:

Unit Testing: Focuses on individual software components (functions, classes) to verify they perform as designed. Developers typically perform unit testing.
Integration Testing: Tests how different modules interact with each other to ensure data flows smoothly between them. This involves testing interfaces and communication protocols.
System Testing: Evaluates the entire system against functional and non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability). It simulates real-world scenarios to identify bugs and integration issues.
Acceptance Testing: (Also known as User Acceptance Testing - UAT) Verifies if the software meets the acceptance criteria defined by the client or end-users. This ensures the system delivers the expected value and functionality.
Importance of Testing in Software Development

Testing is crucial in software development for several reasons:
Early Bug Detection: Testing helps identify and fix bugs early in the development lifecycle, reducing the cost of fixing them later.
Improved Quality: Rigorous testing leads to a higher quality software product with fewer defects and a better user experience.
Reduced Risk: Testing helps mitigate risks associated with software failures, protecting the project's reputation and finances.
Ensures Requirements Met: Testing verifies that the software adheres to the specified requirements and meets user needs.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
A version control system (VCS) is a tool that helps developers track changes made to code over time. It allows them to revert to previous versions if needed, collaborate on projects effectively, and manage different versions of the software.
Reason why VCS are crucial in software development:
Version History: VCS keeps a record of all changes made to the codebase, allowing developers to see how the code evolved and revert to previous versions if necessary.
Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts. VCS merges changes and tracks who made them.
Branching and Merging: Developers can create isolated branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Once complete, they can merge these branches back into the main code.
Backup and Disaster Recovery: VCS acts as a secure backup of the codebase, allowing recovery in case of accidental deletion or system failures.
Popular VCS and Features
Git: A widely used, distributed VCS known for its speed, efficiency, and offline capabilities. It offers features like branching, merging, conflict resolution, and a rich command line interface.
Subversion (SVN): A centralized VCS with a simpler user interface compared to Git. It's easier to learn for beginners but offers less flexibility for branching and merging.
Software Project Management Summary
Software project management is the application of planning, organizing, and controlling resources to bring a software project to a successful completion. It involves activities like:

Project Planning: Defining the project scope, timeline, budget, and resource allocation.
Requirements Engineering: Gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating software requirements.
Design and Development: Designing the software architecture, coding, and unit testing.
Testing and Quality Assurance: Performing various levels of testing to ensure software quality.
Deployment and Maintenance: Releasing the software to users and providing ongoing support.
